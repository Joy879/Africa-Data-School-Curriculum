NLP is a field of AI where we teach machines the syntax and semantics of languages. 
There are two main subfields of NLP:
* NLU - Natural Language Understanding
* NLG - Natural Language Generation


Please refer to [NLP (2) file](https://github.com/Joy879/ADS_REV_code/blob/main/032%20Lesson%20NLP%20Basics/NLP%20(2).pdf) for a detailed rodmap on the journey towards becoming proficent in NLP tasks.

You can also check out the [spacy course](https://course.spacy.io/en/) to get you familiar with the library

NLP is fast becoming one of the pivotal points for AGI to be developed on. As such we need to know how to work with pre-trained large language models for specific use cases. If you don't know what a transfomer model is, please read this [blog](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/03/25/what-is-a-transformer-model/) or watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQQlZhbC5ps) or peruse through these [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/darvind/nlp-using-transformers?qid=7654e4cb-bba0-44dc-bbae-2eb7d12eb2a3&v=&b=&from_search=5).

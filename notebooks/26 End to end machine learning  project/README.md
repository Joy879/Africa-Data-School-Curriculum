## End to End Pipeline

* [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/barelydedicated/bank-customer-churn-modeling/code)
* EDA: Use your analysis knowledge to find out what makes a customer exit the bank
* Prepocessing steps: Encoding, Scaling
* Model Selection: 5 models are chosen
* Hyperparameter tuning: Using grid search to test different parameters
* Feature selection: Using RFE to rank features
* Model evaluation: Checking final performance of model using various metrics
* Model saving: Saving model into a file
* Dashboard: Creating a dashboard to give user an opprotunity to submit values and get predictions

TASKS
* Implement the code on your own from start to end
* Study oversampling/undersampling and use one of those techniques on your dataset to see if model performance would improve
* Explore various notebooks from the kaggle data source site and try to understand the steps taken.
* Use this knowledge to do an end to end project from your preferred dataset from kaggle/uci

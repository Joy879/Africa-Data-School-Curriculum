## Plotly

A way to build interactive graphs with python

We use ```plotly express``` more often because of how simple it is to write code and get results. View comprehensive documentation [here](https://plotly.com/python/)

Also we work with [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) to display interactive notebooks from github.

[Here's today's notebook rendered on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/Joy879/Africa-Data-School-Curriculum/blob/main/notebooks/17%20Plotly/17%20Plotly%20.ipynb)

## Notebooks
You work with notebooks to combine executable code and detailed notes in markdown. You either get notebooks online or on your PC. 
If you work with them in your PC you will work with [Jupyter from Anaconda](https://learning.anaconda.cloud/jupyter-notebook-basics?utm_campaign=learning&utm_medium=documentation&utm_source=anacondadocs&utm_content=distroindexJN) and if online you use either [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code)

# Classification

Part 1 was meant to introduce aspects of scikit learn and additional info about various classification models. As addditional material I recommmend walking through [Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/) to learn more about various models suxh as:
* [Naive Bayes: Best known for working with odds and probabilities](https://course.elementsofai.com/3)
* [Logistic Regression: An adaptation of inear regression for Classification](https://course.elementsofai.com/4/3)
* [Logistic Regression: A practical session with notebook attached](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/lesson/logistic-regression-for-classification)
* [SVM: Support Vector Machines](https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/support-vector-machine-svm-in-python-and-r)
* [Decision Trees and Random Forest](https://jovian.com/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms)
* [K-Nearest-Neighbors](https://course.elementsofai.com/4/2)

### Deep learning

A subset of ML where we focus on models that mimic how our brains work. These models are complex and powerful. They were established in the 1950s but have started to be implemented recently due to availability of data and access to powerful processors called GPUs. They particularly excel in tasks like computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, Generative modelling, etc.

A NN can be thought to have three layers: Input, Hidden and Output layer

The architechture of deep learning models varies and for each type we can have different tasks accomplished. 
For example [CNNs](https://github.com/Joy879/ADS_REV_code/tree/main/030%20CNN) for computer vision and [RNNs](https://github.com/Joy879/ADS_REV_code/tree/main/031%20RNN) for sequntial data.
